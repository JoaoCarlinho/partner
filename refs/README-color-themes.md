I've created an interactive HTML file at docs/ux-color-themes.html. Features:
6 theme options based on Steno brand colors
Live preview with actual UI components (pipeline, chat, case list, buttons)
Semantic color system documentation
Ready-to-use Tailwind CSS configuration
Theme Options:
Professional Purple (Recommended) - Balanced professionalism with warmth
Calming Navy - Trust/stability focused, ideal for debtors
Warm Magenta - Energy and action, good for CTAs
Clean Light - Cursor-inspired minimal
Professional Dark - Dark mode option
Adaptive Dual - Context-aware (purple for creditors, navy for debtors)
Open the file in your browser to explore the themes interactively.

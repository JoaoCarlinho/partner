## Financial Assessment

The financial assessment helps find a payment plan you can actually afford.

### What It Is

A conversation (with AI assistance) about your financial situation:
- Monthly income (ranges are fine)
- Regular expenses
- Other debts or obligations
- How you're feeling about all this

### Privacy

- Everything is confidential
- We don't judge your situation
- Information is only used to help find solutions
- You can skip questions you're not comfortable with

### How It Works

The assessment is conversational, not a form:

> "Let's understand your situation better. There's no judgment here."
>
> "Approximately what's your monthly income?"
>
> "What are your main monthly expenses?"
>
> "Are there other debts you're managing?"

### Why It Helps

With this information, the platform can:
- Suggest realistic payment plans
- Show what similar people have done
- Help you make an informed decision

## Creating a Payment Plan

If you want to pay over time, you can propose a payment plan.

### Plan Options

Plans vary based on your situation:

| Plan Type | Description | Typical Length |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Aggressive** | Higher payments, faster resolution | 3-6 months |
| **Moderate** | Balanced approach | 6-12 months |
| **Conservative** | Lower payments, more time | 12-24 months |
| **Hardship** | Minimal payments if needed | 24+ months |

### Building Your Plan

1. **Starting Point** - Do you have a down payment?
2. **Payment Amount** - What can you pay each period?
3. **Frequency** - Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly?
4. **Duration** - How long to pay it off?

### AI Recommendations

Based on your financial assessment, the platform suggests plans that:
- Fit your stated income and expenses
- Have realistic success rates
- Match what's worked for others in similar situations

### Submitting Your Proposal

1. Review your proposed plan
2. Click "Submit Proposal"
3. Creditor receives and reviews
4. They may accept, reject, or counter-offer

### If They Counter-Offer

The creditor might propose different terms:
- Different payment amount
- Different schedule
- Different total

You can:
- Accept their counter
- Reject and try again
- Continue negotiating

### When You Agree

1. Agreement is documented
2. You both sign electronically
3. Payment schedule is set
4. Reminders sent before each payment

## Your Rights

### Right to Dispute

- You can dispute the debt within 30 days
- Put your dispute in writing
- Creditor must investigate

### Right to Stop Contact

- You can request they stop contacting you
- Must be in writing
- Note: This doesn't make the debt go away

### Protection from Harassment

Creditors CANNOT:
- Call repeatedly to annoy you
- Use threatening language
- Contact you at inconvenient times
- Tell others about your debt
- Lie about the amount or their authority

### Right to Sue

If a creditor violates your rights, you may be able to sue for damages.

## Common Questions

### "What happens if I ignore this?"

The debt doesn't go away. Possible consequences:
- Continued collection attempts
- Potential legal action
- Credit score impact

**Better approach:** Engage with the process, even if just to dispute or negotiate.

### "Can they really sue me?"

Yes, creditors can file lawsuits for unpaid debts. However:
- Many prefer to negotiate
- Payment plans avoid legal action
- Time limits apply (statute of limitations)

### "Will this affect my credit?"

The debt may already be on your credit report. Resolving it:
- Shows you addressed the situation
- May improve your credit over time
- A paid debt looks better than an unpaid one

### "What if I really can't pay anything?"

Options exist:
- Hardship payment plans
- Dispute if the debt isn't valid
- Consult with a public defender
- Bankruptcy (last resort, but it's an option)

### "Is this platform legitimate?"

Yes. This platform:
- Is authorized by the creditor
- Protects your information
- Follows all debt collection laws
- Provides free public defender access

### "What if I already paid this?"

Dispute the debt:
1. Click "Dispute"
2. Explain you believe it's paid
3. Provide any proof you have
4. Creditor must verify or remove
